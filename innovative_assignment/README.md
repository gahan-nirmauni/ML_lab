First attribute : Class value 0 or 1
2nd attribute onwards - select one to work for features

Use this other attributes as input to Neural Network and classify the tuple.

Tweak --- In general, activation function at output layer yields exact class value i.e. 0 or 1 but out put should be probabilistic which we get before classifying it to 0 or 1
